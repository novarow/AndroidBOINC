TODOs

BOINC client:
- merge changes to trunk
- submit build script to BOINC repo. (caution: confustion with Android build script currently present)

BOINC Android manager:
- add logout logic (re-login with different credentials) (project attach)
- add register project account logic
- add compatibility check for ARCH and ABI. (has to be done by "app store"??)
- Status Tab: add network status, redesign layout, add aquired project credit, save state when logging in.
- Transfers Tab: add network status
- Preferences: bug, if default values are changed before client finishes start up (e.g. while benchmarking), they become override settings and dont change to project settings. (hide until project settings?)
- Messages: implement, find right RPC call
-> find RPC calls and parse all above needed information accordingly
